Imagining a world without time is a fascinating thought exercise, but one that turns our perception of reality on its head.

A frozen universe:

Without time, everything would be frozen in a static snapshot. Movement, change, growth and death would not exist. Objects and beings would eternally retain the same position, the same form, the same state.

Concept of “before” and “after” non-existent:

Notions of before and after, cause and effect, would lose their meaning. There would be no past, present or future. The universe would be a frozen tapestry, with no sequence or progression.

Absence of consciousness:

Consciousness, as we know it, is intimately linked to the passage of time. It is based on the flow of our thoughts, memories and experiences. Without time, it's hard to imagine how consciousness could exist.

Modified laws of physics:

Time plays a fundamental role in the laws of physics as we know them. Thermodynamics, classical mechanics and general relativity are all based on the concept of time passing. A universe without time would require an entirely new physics.
